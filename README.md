Quantum Theory applied to Chemistry

Read literature and write code for Quantum Theory applied in Chemistry

## Goals

1. complete [qtca][Quantum Theory for Chemical Applications by Jochen Autschbach]
2. complete [mest][Molecular Electronic Structure Theory by Trygve Helgaker]

## Tools

- [af][Arrayfire] provides GPU non-specific (i.e. opencl/cuda) linear algebra
  functionality

## Why homing-pigeon?

Professor Autschbach gave me [sct][Schrodinger's Cat Trilogy] for completing my PhD studies.
The final book is called "The Homing Pigeons".
